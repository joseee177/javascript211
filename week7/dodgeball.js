// CODE PLAN
 
//  Create two classes, one to represent a person and one a dodgeball player
 
//  Transfer a person to being a dodgeball player then add that new player to an array of players. Allow users to select button to trasnfer that new dodgeball player to either red or blue team.
 
// TESTING
 
//  1) A new player object was created when a person is pulled from the arrOfPeople
//  2) The new player was added to the listOfPlayers[]
//  3) A new team member was created for both the red and blue teams
